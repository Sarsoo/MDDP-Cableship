The use of Ammonia fuel cells for power generation on the vessel provides
 the opportunity to eliminate direct

 emissions from the vessel; when produced using renewable energy (
\emph on

 From an electrical perspective, however, the current-voltage characteristics
 of such a system must be considered.

 presents the I-V characteristics for a typical fuel cell, it can be seen
 that drawing more current from a cell reduces it's voltage.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $P=IV$

, this inverse relationship results in an optimum current draw to operate
 with the highest efficiency or power density.
 Operating outside of this area will accentuate losses, the dominant effects

 Comparing the two graphs, it can be seen that the optimum operating state
 would be in R-2; in fact drawing excess current and pushing into R-3 can
 damage the cell,

From these figures, fuel cells could be described as being sensitive to
 a noisy or dynamic load draw.
 This could pose a complication if these cells to be directly coupled to
 the drive motor stage where changes in thrust and therefore required power
 can be vary quickly, especially when using dynamic positioning in a high
 sea state.
 Ideally, the use of more cells operating in their optimum state would be
 preferred over increasing the draw on a smaller population

\end_inset

.
 However, this increase in active cells is not an instantaneous operation
 and cells require time to reach their optimum state.
 To allow this focus on efficiency, the load including hotel and propulsion
 power should be decoupled from the fuel cells with an electrical storage
 buffer in between.
 This will allow the buffer to absorb spikes in load draw and allow the
 fuel cells to increase power generation by increasing active cells instead
 of individual draw.

The following outlines solutions for this described buffer, rechargeable
 batteries are the natural option and as such this is considered first.
 Other, innovative solutions are also outlined before the implementation
 of a suitable solution is presented along with the safety and financial

Rechargeable Battery Chemistry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many different methods for constructing a traditional rechargeable
 battery or 
\emph on
secondary cell
\emph default
; the chemistry of the reactants determines the characteristics of the system
 as well as having drastic implications on the safety and sustainability.
 Secondary cells are a consumable item, their components degrade with usage
 and this lifespan will be reduced if not constructed and maintained correctly.
 This only accentuates the importance of the solution's sustainability as
 it constitute a significant amount of material which will periodically
 require source and disposal.

 As can be seen, Lithium-ion technology leads the other solutions in most
 of the categories.
 While Nickel-Cadmium has a higher lifespan than Li-ion there are other
 factors that led to this being discounted.
 NiCd suffers from the

, where frequent charge/discharge cycles lead to the battery 
\emph on

 Additionally, Cadmium is a highly toxic heavy metal requiring specialist
 containment; in fact, many types of Cadmium battery are now banned in the
 EU.

\begin_layout Standard
While the use of robotics has made sub-sea cable repair operations more
 efficient, durable and accurate, as will be discussed there are situations
 where this is not available and it is worth briefly outlining how grapnels
 are used in repair operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Grapnels are specialised tools attached to lengths of chain which trail
 the stern of the ship.
 For cable repair operations, a cut & hold grapnel is used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "cut-and-hold-paper,cut-and-hold-eta-product"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 With knowledge of the path of the subject cable and the location of the
 fault, the grapnel is lowered before the boat makes a pass perpendicular
 to the cable.
 As the grapnel makes contact it is able to both cut and grip the cable
 before being raised to the surface vessel.

Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Operations [AP]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following section outlines how the use of an unmanned underwater vehicle
 (UUV) can make mission operations more efficient and precise.
 The state of current UUV usage throughout cable repair operations is outlined
 in order to identify the critical capabilities, requirements and advantages
 over traditional grapnel operations.
 The future of the domain is then explored and the challenges in applying
 these developments to sub-sea cable repair are identified before exploring
 how these can be overcome in order to meet the determined requirements.
 Prior to this, the domain of UUVs as a whole is described in order to outline
 the scope of available vehicles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
UUV Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
ROVs and AUVs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UUVs can be divided into two categories based on their control scheme.
 Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) and autonomous underwater vehicles
 (AUV) are distinguished by whether a human is controlling the vehicle or
 whether it operates independently; as such they have different applications.
 ROVs have been the vehicle class of choice where complex intervention and
 actuation is required such as offshore oil and gas operations and cable
 repair.
 A human operator controls the vehicle from the surface vessel, bi-directional
 communication including data, control, video and power are transmitted
 through an umbilical cord tether between the two vessels.
 AUVs on the other hand have primarily been used for survey and research
 purposes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This distinction in responsibilities is not static, however.
 Like other robotics domains such as auto-mobiles and ships, autonomy is
 a rapidly developing area of research and development; newer vehicles are
 able to complete more complex operations without human intervention and
 with longer endurance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Physical Configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical layout of a UUV can generally be described by one of two classes,
 box frames or torpedo shaped.
 
\begin_inset Flex TODO Note (Margin)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
determined by the size and range of the vehicle.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

Box frame UUVs are typically larger with more space for instruments and
 actuators but are not expected to make longer distance journeys as a result
 of their poor hydrodynamic profile.
 Torpedo shaped vehicles tend to be smaller without actuators; their hydrodynami
c profile makes them well suited for faster, longer distance missions however
 this comes at the cost of reduced stability and control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Current ROV Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cable repair operations are currently undertaken, where possible, with human-con
trolled ROVs.
 With visual contact and direct actuation at the seabed, the ROV is used
 to identify, cut and grip the cable for retrieval to the surface-vessel.
 In doing so the need for repeated motions of the ship across the cable
 is removed, saving time and fuel.
 Instead the surface vessel uses dynamic positioning in order to maintain
 it's position above the ROV and cable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this finer control is a key benefit for ROV use over grapnels, one
 of the most important benefits is the ability to bury repaired cables in
 the sea floor using high-powered water jets.
 70% of cable damage is caused by man-made activity, of which over a third
 is a result of fishing activity; another quarter is as a result ship anchors
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ultra-map-cable-damage-causes"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 As such, the ability to protect sub-sea cables in shallower waters by burying
 them from human intervention is a key parameter in protecting cables from
 further damage.
 While this can be completed with a separate plough, this would require
 more deck space, motion of the surface vessel.
 Ploughs are also typically extremely heavy pieces of equipment and would
 make the vessel less efficient overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for fine movement control and actuators with which to manipulate
 cables has led to box frame vehicles dominating this field, figure

 lists the specifications for the ROVs currently being used as part of the
 ACMA cable repair agreement along with similarly classed vehicles from
 other providers.
 As can be seen, current ROVs for this domain have a maximum working depth
 of about 3 km.
 This poses a problem to cable repair operations where, further out to sea,
 the sea floor can extend much further, see figure

\end_inset

.
 While ROVs could be capable, in theory, of reaching lower depths it is
 important to balance these working capabilities with other considerations
 such as price and weight.
 In practice, this working depth is a reasonable range to work within, it
 could be argued that the most important capability of current ROVs is their
 ability to re-bury the cable post-repair.
 As described previously, this is in order to protect the cable from human
 intervention including fishing and anchor operations.
 These incidents are more prevalent in shallower waters within the operating
 range of the ROV, therefore it is acceptable to use a grapnel outside of
 this operating range where burying the cable is less important.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Advantages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An advantage of using an autonomous vehicle would be the lack of need for
 the surface vessel to maintain position directly above the ROV and fault;
 instead the surface vessel would stay within a larger area only to maintain
 contact with the UUV.
 This could reduce the required power directed to dynamic positioning which
 in higher sea states can become a significant draw.
 Additionally as the UUV can move independently, the surface vehicle would
 not need to directly track the vehicles movement; for example when the
 UUV is re-burying the repaired cable in shallower waters.
 This would, again, lower the required propulsion power used by the surface
 vessel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage could be a reduction in risk during mission operations.
 With a traditional tethered ROV, should the umbilical cable be broken the
 vehicle would likely lose functionality and require specialist recovery.
 This break could occur as a result of a fault in the tether management
 system, high storm activity causing too much tension on the system, or
 in less likely scenarios, animal intervention.
 An autonomous vehicle has no tether to break and a hybrid ROV/AUV could
 likely be instructed to take control and return home should the tether
 break during missions involving direct human control.

Domain Challenges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Navigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, one of the main advantages of using an autonomous vehicle
 for sub-sea cable repairs would be the physical de-coupling of the vehicles,
 however this also poses the most significant challenge.
 In typical ROV operations, the operator has knowledge of the location of
 the ROV relative to the surface vessel.
 As the surface vessel is GNSS
\begin_inset Foot

-enabled (Likely GPS) it has knowledge of its position in world co-ordinates
 and the operator can use this to reduce the ROV's cable search space.
\begin_inset Flex TODO Note (Margin)

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Diagram?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decoupling the vehicles introduces complications that are not necessarily
 typical to the existing use cases for AUVs.
 The frequency of EM waves used by GNSS systems do not penetrate deep through
 the water and an AUV must be able to operate without world co-ordinates
 provided in this manner.
 As such, navigation systems used by AUVs are typically 
\emph on
dead reckoning
\emph default
 systems.
 This is a form of navigation that operates relative to a known fixed point
 (where a UUV is deployed for example) as opposed to one relative to world
 co-ordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With an accurate system, this will satisfy many surveying and research use
 cases where relative location data can be transformed to world-coordinates
 after the fact.
 This will prove less effective when the vehicle is expected to autonomously
 navigate to a specific location (the cable fault).
 A dead reckoning system as described above uses relative sensors to measure
 it's speed and infer it's current location however these relative sensors
 have associated measurement errors which accumulate over time.
 This would be more pronounced under the water where sea currents are liable
 to accentuate these errors, the efficacy of an AUV's fault location capabilitie
s may be reduced to the point of unacceptability.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Proposed Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vehicle will be designed for hybrid ROV/AUV operations.
 The vehicle should be able to complete missions independently of the surface
 vessel with the ability to operate in a similar fashion to existing ROVs
 (human controller, tethered power and data connection).
 This will have a number of benefits, primarily that the vehicle should
 be able to benefit from autonomous operation where possible with the ability
 for direct human control in missions deemed to complex for autonomous control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existing remit of AUV operations is primarily survey, inspection and
 light intervention, it is likely that the autonomous capabilities of this
 vehicle would not be capable of conducting all existing cable repair missions
 which involve a lot more involved intervention.
 It is important that enabling autonomous operations does not ultimately
 reduce it's operating capabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously described, box frame UUVs are well suited to sub-sea cable
 operations where fine movement control and space for actuators are critical.
 As such a box frame of similar specifications to those currently used,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "global-marine-atlas-data-sheet,rov-hector-7-datasheet"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 will be used.
 The vehicle will likely be at the larger and heavier end of existing ROVs
 as the vehicle must now have the onboard energy capabilities to complete
 a mission without a constant power supply from the surface vessel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the UUV is now expected to operate independently of the surface vessel,
 it should have the ability to bi-directionally wirelessly communicate with
 the surface vessel.
 Uses for such a communications channel include the UUV reporting it's mission
 status and the surface vessel providing high-level instructions such as
 
\emph on
return home
\emph default
 orders.
 When operating underwater, acoustic signals are the primary medium for
 wireless communication.

\begin_layout Standard
As previously described, the navigation system will primarily be built on
 the principle of 
\emph on
dead reckoning
\emph default
 using an inertial navigation system (INS).
 An INS uses input from many types of sensor such as accelerometers and
 gyroscopes to measure the movement of the vehicle and hence infer it's
 location.
 None of these could individually provide an accurate determination of location
 and as such 
\emph on
sensor fusion
\emph default
 is employed.
 Each sensor has an associated measurement uncertainty which compounds over
 time, sensor fusion allows all the sensor measurements to be combined in
 such a way as to produce a single output measurement with an uncertainty
 smaller than any of each sensor individually.
 A common method for implementing sensor fusion is using a 
\emph on
Kalman filter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, despite the use of a Kalman filter allowing more precise approximations
 of the vehicles relative location, the lack of external calibrating updates
 means that the overall uncertainty will still continually increase over
 time.
 In land-based robotics this is mitigated through the use of periodic GPS
 measurements which have low, constant uncertainty and help to place an
 upper bound on the overall error.
 As previously mentioned, GNSS systems do not work deep underwater and as
 such, another method for providing these external updates must be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following proposes methods for providing global positioning to the UUV
 without a traditional GNSS system.
 This will be completed in two stages, the first being to provide the UUV
 with the ability to measure the location of a fixed point relative to itself.
 In parallel, the global co-ordinates of this fixed point will be communicated
 to the UUV in order to infer it's own global location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Underwater Acoustic Positioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alongside the use of acoustic signals for communications it will also be
 employed for positioning.
 One application for this is underwater acoustic positioning which employs
 the use of time-of-flight measurements to beacons of a known location to
 triangulate an object's location.
 There are different configurations for such a system depending on how these
 beacons are laid out, 
\emph on
long-baseline
\emph default
 (LBL) systems involve beacons located on the sea floor.
 Spreading these beacons around the working area of an ROV widens the baseline
 of the system and provides higher accuracy when triangulating.
 This configuration is best suited to static areas of research such as ship
 wrecks where an initial time devoted to deploying and calibrating these
 underwater beacons is a reasonable expense to pay for the required high
 accuracy.
 This is not the case for sub-sea cable repairs where the deployment, calibratio
n and recovery of beacons on the seabed would be prohibitively complex and
 add significant time to the duration of a mission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Short-baseline
\emph default
 (SBL) systems involve a number of beacons placed at the furthest corners
 of the surface vessel, this has the benefit of requiring little set-up
 and pack-down at the cost of reduced accuracy.
 Relative to the UUV these beacons are all on a similar bearing when operating
 at a distance, as a result changes in the vehicle's location would be reflected
 in similar changes to the measurements from all of the beacons.
 Previously, with a long-baseline, the beacons are ideally surrounding the
 UUV's working area and changes in its location are reflected in different
 distance deltas for each beacon allowing tighter triangulation.
 Accuracy can be improved by extending the beacons away from the vessel
 to extend the baseline as far as possible.

\begin_layout Standard
One method to mitigate the drawbacks of both described methods is by using
 GPS Intelligent Buoys (GIBs).
 This configuration, also referred to as an 
\emph on
inverted long-baseline
\emph default
, allows a much wider baseline than the surface-vessel-mounted beacons by
 deploying a group of 
\emph on
smart buoys
\emph default
 around the expected working area of the UUV.
 The use of buoys as opposed to beacons on the sea-floor significantly decreases
 the preparation and clean-up mission phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these methods it is proposed that the surface vessel be equipped with
 a short-baseline beacon array as well as a population of GIBs.
 This will allow the choice between higher accuracy or faster mission turnaround
 be decided by mission conditions as well as providing redundancy for either
 system.
 In shallower waters, the accuracy of the onboard SBL may be deemed sufficient
 however in deeper water where the UUV is operating far further from the
 surface vessel, the compactness of the SBL baseline may require the higher
 accuracy of the GIBs
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In practice the two could be used in conjunction for efficiency.
 As the UUV is deployed it initially uses the onboard SBL array while the
 surface vessel makes a pass around the working area deploying GIBs for
 use as the UUV gets deeper
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The GIBs would be considered additional accuracy, the SBL would be used
 alongside the GIBs and act as an extra node in the array.
 Additionally the weather and sea conditions could play a factor in the
 decision.
 In higher sea states and stormy weather, the deployment and recovery of
 GIBs may be deemed too risky and the SBL could be used alone.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Global Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above underwater acoustic positioning system will allow the UUV to keep
 track of it's position relative to known points at the surface, however
 this alone will not provide the UUV with its global location.
 In order for the UUV to calibrate it's local map to global co-ordinates,
 the global position of these surface points must be provided.
 This will be conducted over the previously described acoustic communication
 channel.
 As it could be expected that this channel has a low bandwidth, these updates
 need not be excessively frequent.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While accelerometers and gyroscopes would be expected components of any
 mobile dead reckoning navigation system, additional sensors well-suited
 to sub-sea localisation will allow the vessel's movement to be more precise.
 One such sensor is a 
\emph on
Doppler velocity log
\emph default
 (DVL) which estimates the vessel's velocity by tracking the seabed.
 DVLs apply the broader concept of 
\emph on
acoustic Doppler current profiling
\emph default
 which measures the velocity of water by measuring the change in frequency
 caused by the Doppler effect.
 Combined with depth measurements calculated from the signal's echo time,
 this can be used to estimate the vessel's velocity.
 DVLs are crucial to a sub-sea INS as, like GPS, their error does not grow
 when employed correctly unlike other relative sensors.
 As described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

, a sensor who's measurement error does not compound and grow but stays
 constant is important as it places an upper bound on the overall error
 and allows the system to maintain accuracy over time.

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing how this project aims to leverage 
\emph on
digitalisation

 it is worth defining the term and the adjacent term 
\emph on
digitisation

.
 Digitisation describes the transforming of data or a process from an analogue
 system to a digital one,

 It is a value-neutral term in of itself and could have positive or negative
 effects.
 A simple example would be transitioning from working with pen-and-paper
 forms to digital documents and PDFs.

 To follow the above example, digitalisation could include using groupware
 in order to collaboratively work on a cloud document as opposed to delivering
 hard copy revisions of a document between locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a broad concept, there are many ways that the concept of digitalisation
 could be applied to this project, as a whole, though, the initiative could
 be described as a
