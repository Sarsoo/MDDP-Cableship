Environmental sustainability includes consideration of concepts such as
 energy usage and production, emissions, water usage and quality, food and
 land usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The social aspect includes consideration for the effects of war, labour
 standards, social justice and poverty among others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economic sustainability can define economic growth that takes into account
 the above concepts.
 For example, economic development is typically measured in gross domestic
 product (GDP), however this metric does not include social aspects such
 as equality, a population's average wage or access to healthcare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many formal initiatives and goals for sustainable development,
 the main strategies with which this project aligns itself are the United
 Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.

Hotel Load [AP]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hotel load is defined as the energy usage not related to the propulsion
 including lighting and power outlets.
 An estimation of this load for the vessel was modelled and a breakdown
 can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:hotel-load"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The total load was estimated at 680 kWh per day.
 As can be seen, the oven and food refrigeration make up the majority and
 so 3 methods for refrigeration were investigated in order to find the most
 energy efficient solution with SDG 7 in mind.
 These included a collection of standard upright fridges, all-in-one cold
 rooms and a bespoke cold room.
 All-in-one cold-rooms were the most energy efficient and were selected
 as a result.

Efficiency Investigations

\begin_layout Subsection
Solar [AP]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scope of the vessel's solar energy capabilities were investigated with
 the intention of supplementing the chemical energy of the ammonia fuel
 cells.
 The capabilities of photovoltaic cells covering an area of the vessel's
 footprint are considered and compared with both the financial and carbon
 cost in an effort to determine whether the proposal would be effective
 in achieving the goal of net-zero operations and SDG 9 specifically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected available area capable of hosting photovoltaic cells was estimated
 to be 26m x 30m or 780 m

.
 Using the same solar panel modelling of GEORGE, this would equate to 441
 panels with a max power of 176 kW, an order of magnitude smaller than the
 ammonia fuel cell capabilities.
 This would represent 123 tonnes of embodied carbon which could be reduced
 to 65 tonnes by recycling following decommission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of this projection, it is proposed that the vessel is not fitted
 with solar panels.
 As the other energy being generated via the ammonia cells is already carbon-zer
o (assuming the use of 
\emph on
green ammonia
\emph default
), the embodied carbon of the panels would not be offset through their own
 use.
 This carbon cost would need to be offset via the project-level offsetting
 processes, see JASON.
 The benefits would be limited to the financial savings of reducing fuel
 usage, limiting carbon cost is more of a priority for this project.

 From an electrical perspective, however, the current-voltage characteristics

 presents the I-V characteristics for a typical fuel cell, it can be seen
 that drawing more current from a cell reduces its voltage.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $P=IV$

, this inverse relationship results in an optimum current draw to operate
 with the highest efficiency or power density.
 Operating outside of this area will accentuate losses, the dominant effects
 of each operating region can be seen in figure

From these figures, fuel cells could be described as being sensitive to
 a noisy or dynamic load such as changes in thrust and therefore the required
 power can vary quickly.
 For example, when using dynamic positioning in a high sea state.
 Ideally, the use of more cells operating in their optimum state would be
 preferred over increasing the draw on a smaller population

.
 However, this increase in active cells is not an instantaneous operation
 and cells require time to reach their optimum state.
 To allow this focus on efficiency, the load including hotel and propulsion
 power should be decoupled from the fuel cells with an electrical storage
 buffer in between.
 This will allow the buffer to absorb spikes in load draw and allow the
 fuel cells to increase power output by increasing active cells instead
 of individual draw.
 This initiative was conducted with SDGs 7 (Affordable and clean energy)
 and 12 (Responsible consumption and production) in mind, although goal
 14 (Life below the water) is also important due to the materials involved
 in the considered solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following section outlines solutions for this described buffer, rechargeable
 batteries are the natural option and as such this is considered first.
 Other, innovative solutions are also outlined before the implementation
 of a suitable solution is presented along with the safety and financial
 implications of such a system.

Rechargeable Battery Chemistry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many different methods for constructing a traditional rechargeable
 battery or 
\emph on
secondary cell
\emph default
; the chemistry of the reactants determines the characteristics of the system
 as well as having drastic implications on the safety and sustainability.
 Secondary cells are a consumable item, their components degrade with usage
 and this lifespan will be reduced if not constructed and maintained correctly.
 This only accentuates the importance of the solution's sustainability as
 it constitutes a significant amount of material which will periodically
 require replacing and disposal.

 outlines the relevant characteristics for the most common configurations
 of rechargeable battery.
 As can be seen, Lithium-ion technology leads the other solutions in most
 of the categories.
 While Nickel-Cadmium has a higher lifespan than Li-ion there are other
 factors that led to this being discounted.
 NiCd suffers from the

memory effect

, where frequent charge/discharge cycles lead to the battery

 the point at which charging began and experiencing a drop in voltage past

The main disadvantage relevant to the required applications is the required

 Flow batteries typically have a much lower energy and power density than
 traditional rechargeable batteries, a comparison of values for various

.
 Both values are critical for the vessel; as a buffer for absorbing large
 peaks from the propulsion, it is key that a high power can be drawn from
 the solution.
 From the presented values, Lithium-ion can provide between about 3 and
 7 times as much power draw than redox flow batteries.
 Looking to energy or capacity density, Li-ion is roughly 4 to 10 times
 higher.

To achieve the capacity and power requirements defined by the propulsion
 system, a flow battery would likely need vastly more space and weigh significan
tly more.
 The weight penalty would prove more damaging as this would require more
 fuel for propulsion and lower the efficiency of the vessel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although flow batteries have found applications in large-capacity applications
 including grid services from load balancing to peak shaving, these are
 typically stationary without as much of a volume restriction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Solid-State
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previously described traditional rechargeable batteries have a liquid
 electrolyte in which the electrodes are submerged.
 This solution allows ions to pass between the electrodes during charge
 and discharge.
 Systems in which this liquid electrolyte is instead a solid are called
 solid-state batteries (SSB).
 This provides an advantage in that these liquid electrolytes are typically
 one of the key causes of safety concerns as they are flammable and sometimes
 toxic.
 These are important considerations for this domain.
 With less of a concern regarding high operating temperatures, this also
 allows SSBs to be charged faster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the system has the opportunity to increase energy density,
 thereby reducing the required space while increasing the available capacity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, however, there are a number of considerations that, currently,
 make it unsuitable for the required application.
 As an active area of research without much commercial availability, the
 price of solid-state batteries is much higher than that of other formats,
 for comparison, the

.
 Additionally, concerns associated with Lithium-ion batteries including
 overheating and explosion are not completely removed by transitioning to
 an SSB.
 Dendrites are structures of Lithium that can form during charging and dischargi
ng as a result of electrodeposition.
 While this should occur evenly across the electrode, if uneven it can cause
 columns to grow towards the separator, figure

.
 As these grow they can penetrate through this separator and make contact
 with the cathode.
 This will cause a short circuit, rapidly increasing heat and potentially
 causing fire and explosion.

As with other battery cells, the voltage is a characteristic of the chemistry,
 for Lithium this is around 3.6 V.
 The key parameters that vary amongst producers are the capacity and charge/disc
harge C-rates.
 In order to estimate the cell specification for use in this project, the
 existing range of available cells was taken into account.
 Typical, mid-range 18650 cells can vary between 2500 - 3000 mAh capacity;
 the highest energy density can currently extend this to 3500 - 3600 mAh.
 As technology improves, it is expected that by the point of construction
 this higher range will be more accessible and reliable, and as such, 3500
 mAh is used as the cell capacity for further calculations.

 The result was 193,600 cells.
 These cells are arranged into a matrix of parallel and series blocks, all

\begin_layout Standard
The balance of parallel to series blocks is not a critical parameter for
 the application and can instead be tuned for efficiency; as the propulsion
 units require AC power, transformers can be used to select a desired voltage

 For high power applications high voltage is typically preferred to high
 current which corresponds to a higher weighting of series length.

Safety
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Lithium-ion batteries are typically safe and stable if stored and
 used correctly, abuse can cause severe safety issues.
 As previously mentioned, the liquid organic electrolyte is flammable, and
 combined with the high energy density of Li-ion batteries can lead to thermal
 runaway and eventually fire if not handled correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a couple of causes for such a thermal runaway, these include physical
 damage, short circuits, overcharging and exposure to high temperature,

\begin_layout Standard
As previously described, Lithium-ion cells are sensitive to stressful electrical
 conditions such as overcharging, deep discharging and excessive current
 draw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to protect and enforce operating conditions for the Lithium cells,
 a battery management system or BMS is used.
 A BMS implements safety protocols to mitigate the above effects as well
 as providing information to the load and other monitoring services such
 as state-of-charge information (remaining capacity),

\begin_layout Standard
Lithium-ion cells are a consumable item that degrades.
 The environmental and financial cost of replacement creates a significant
 incentive to extend this as much as possible as long as this does not inhibit
 the operating capabilities beyond the specification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously mentioned, the temperature of the cells is a key parameter
 affecting both performance and lifespan, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Although operating at a higher temperature increases performance it also
 decreases lifespan.
 Temperature control is already critical for safety purposes.
 20°C provides the ideal temperature for prolonging lifespan and as such
 will be set as the target temperature,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important aspect to the lifespan of Lithium-ion batteries is the
 depth-of-discharge (DOD) which determines the number of charge cycles that
 the battery will last for.
 The depth-of-discharge describes the amount of capacity used each cycle
 before recharging.
 Lithium batteries are able to handle moderate DOD without significantly
 affecting the lifespan, however, frequent deep discharge cycles, completely
 emptying the battery, will shorten its life,

 To prevent deep discharges, more ammonia fuel cells should start up as
 the capacity decreases in order to balance the workload meaning that the
 ammonia management system will need to interface with the BMS.
 Additionally, it would be the responsibility of the BMS to charge cells
 to a reasonable voltage, 3.9 - 4.1 V can provide a balance between higher
 capacity and longer lifespan,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The life-cycle analysis (LCA) of Lithium-ion batteries is a complicated
 process for a couple of reasons.
 As repeatedly stated, Li-ion batteries have been critical to the explosion
 of mobile consumer electronics; the development of the fabrication process
 and the associated environmental effects has changed dramatically.
 More recent LCAs and meta-analyses of previous data are considered in order
 to account for this.
 Additionally, as a global product the values for various greenhouse gas
 (GHG) and other emissions is contingent on the country within which the
 cells are made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the cumulative energy demand (CED) and the GHG emissions are considered.
 Cumulative energy demand allows abstraction of the specific method of energy
 production and the associated emissions.

 The battery will not be used until failure but instead until it cannot

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed buffer solution includes 193,600 NCM Lithium-ion cells requiring
 replacement every 2.3 years.
 As a result of this replacement rate, it is stipulated that the battery
 be re-appropriated for second-use such as energy storage following decommission
 in order to extend their life and reduce the environmental impact.
 Manufacturers using recycled materials should also be identified in order
 to reduce the impact of mining virgin materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth noting that this is the proposed solution based on the current
 state of energy storage.
 One of the only advantages of rechargeable batteries being a consumable
 item requiring replacement is that when this occurs, it is an opportunity
 to re-evaluate the system design.
 With an expected project lifespan of 30 years, it is highly unlikely that
 the use of Li-ion cells will remain the best option.

 these developments to sub-sea cable repair are identified before exploring
 how these can be overcome in order to meet the determined requirements.
 Prior to this, the domain of UUVs as a whole is described in order to outline
 the scope of available vehicles.

UUV Classes

\begin_layout Paragraph
ROVs and AUVs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UUVs can be divided into two categories based on their control scheme.
 Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) and autonomous underwater vehicles
 (AUV) are distinguished by whether a human is controlling the vehicle or
 whether it operates independently; as such they have different applications.
 ROVs have been the vehicle class of choice where complex intervention and
 actuation is required such as offshore oil and gas operations and cable
 repair.
 A human operator controls the vehicle from the surface vessel; bi-directional
 communication including data, control, video and power are transmitted
 through an umbilical cord tether between the two vessels.
 AUVs on the other hand have primarily been used for survey and research
 purposes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This distinction in responsibilities is not static, however.
 Like other robotics domains such as auto-mobiles and ships, autonomy is
 a rapidly developing area of research and development; newer vehicles are
 able to complete more complex operations without human intervention and
 with longer endurance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Physical Configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The physical layout of a UUV can generally be described by one of two classes,
 box frames or torpedo shaped.
 
\begin_inset Flex TODO Note (Margin)

determined by the size and range of the vehicle.
\end_layout

\end_inset

Box frame UUVs are typically larger with more space for instruments and
 actuators but are not expected to make longer distance journeys as a result
 of their poor hydrodynamic profile.
 Torpedo shaped vehicles tend to be smaller without actuators; their hydrodynami
c profile makes them well suited for faster, longer distance missions however
 this comes at the cost of reduced stability and control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Current ROV Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cable repair operations are currently undertaken, where possible, with human-con
trolled ROVs.
 With visual contact and direct actuation at the seabed, the ROV is used
 to identify, cut and grip the cable for retrieval to the surface-vessel.
 In doing so the need for repeated motions of the ship across the cable
 is removed, saving time and fuel.
 Instead, the surface vessel uses dynamic positioning in order to maintain
 its position above the ROV and cable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this finer control is a key benefit for ROV use over grapnels, one
 of the most important benefits is the ability to bury repaired cables in
 the sea floor using high-powered water jets.
 70% of cable damage is caused by man-made activity, of which over a third
 is a result of fishing activity; another quarter is as a result ship anchors
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 As such, the ability to protect sub-sea cables in shallower waters by burying
 them from human intervention is a key parameter in protecting cables from
 further damage and extending the time between repairs.
 While this can be completed with a separate plough, this would require
 more deck space and motion of the surface vessel.
\end_layout

 cables has led to box frame vehicles dominating this field, figure

 lists the specifications for the ROVs currently being used as part of the
 ACMA cable repair agreement along with similarly classed vehicles from
 other providers.
 As can be seen, current ROVs for this domain have a maximum working depth
 of about 3 km.
 This poses a problem to cable repair operations where, further out to sea,
 the sea floor can extend much further, see figure

\end_inset

.
 While ROVs could be capable, in theory, of reaching lower depths it is
 important to balance these working capabilities with other considerations
 such as price and weight.
 In practice, while this working depth is a reasonable range to work within,
 it could be argued that the most important capability of current ROVs is
 their ability to re-bury the cable post-repair.
 As described previously, this is in order to protect the cable from human
 intervention including fishing and anchor operations.
 These incidents are more prevalent in shallower waters within the operating
 range of the ROV, therefore it is acceptable to use a grapnel outside of
 this operating range where burying the cable is less important.

Advantages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An advantage of using an autonomous vehicle would be the lack of need for
 the surface vessel to maintain position directly above the ROV and fault;
 instead the surface vessel would stay within a larger area only to maintain
 contact with the UUV.
 This could reduce the required power directed to dynamic positioning which
 in higher sea states can become a significant draw.
 Additionally, as the UUV can move independently, the surface vehicle would
 not need to directly track the vehicles movement; for example, when the
 UUV is re-burying the repaired cable in shallower waters.
 This would, again, lower the required propulsion power used by the surface
 vessel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another advantage could be a reduction in risk during mission operations.
 With a traditional tethered ROV, should the umbilical cable be broken the
 vehicle would likely lose functionality and require specialist recovery.
 This break could occur as a result of a fault in the tether management
 system, high storm activity causing too much tension on the system, or
 in less likely scenarios, animal intervention.
 An autonomous vehicle has no tether to break and a hybrid ROV/AUV could
 likely be instructed to take control and return home should the tether
 break during missions involving direct human control

Navigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, one of the main advantages of using an autonomous vehicle
 for sub-sea cable repairs would be the physical de-coupling of the vehicles,
 however this also poses the most significant challenge.
 In typical ROV operations, the operator has knowledge of the location of
 the ROV relative to the surface vessel.
 As the surface vessel is GNSS

 and the operator can use this to reduce the ROV's cable search space.
\begin_inset Flex TODO Note (Margin)

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decoupling the vehicles introduces complications that are not necessarily
 typical to the existing use cases for AUVs.
 The frequency of EM waves used by GNSS systems do not penetrate deep through
 the water and an AUV must be able to operate without world co-ordinates
 provided in this manner.
 As such, navigation systems used by AUVs are typically 
\emph on
dead reckoning
\emph default
 systems.
 This is a form of navigation that operates relative to a known fixed point
 (where a UUV is deployed for example) as opposed to one relative to world
 co-ordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With an accurate system, this will satisfy many surveying and research use
 cases where relative location data can be transformed to world-coordinates
 after the fact.
 This will prove less effective when the vehicle is expected to autonomously
 navigate to a specific location (the cable fault).
 A dead reckoning system as described above uses relative sensors to measure
 speed and infer the current location however these relative sensors have
 associated measurement errors which accumulate over time.
 This would be more pronounced under the water where sea currents are liable
 to accentuate these errors, the efficacy of an AUV's fault location capabilitie
s may be reduced to the point of unacceptability.

Launch & Recovery

\begin_layout Standard
By allowing the UUV to operate untethered underwater, complications are
 introduced to the method by which it is launched and recovered to the surface
 vessel.
 A tethered ROV of the size being considered typically has a top-hat tether
 management system (TMS) responsible for controlling the slack in the umbilical
 cable, an example can be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Smaller vehicles can also use a garage-style TMS where the tether attaches
 to a box-like cradle that houses the UUV within.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Proposed Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vehicle will be designed for hybrid ROV/AUV operations.
 The vehicle should be able to complete missions independently of the surface
 vessel with the ability to operate in a similar fashion to existing ROVs
 (human controller, tethered power and data connection).
 This will have a number of benefits, primarily that the vehicle should
 be able to benefit from autonomous operation where possible with the ability
 for direct human control in missions deemed too complex for autonomous
 control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existing remit of AUV operations is primarily survey, inspection and
 light intervention, it is likely that the autonomous capabilities of this
 vehicle would not be capable of conducting all existing cable repair missions
 which involve more intervention.
 It is important that enabling autonomous operations does not ultimately
 reduce its operating capabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously described, box frame UUVs are well suited to sub-sea cable
 operations where fine movement control and space for actuators are critical.
 As such a box frame of similar specifications to those currently used,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "global-marine-atlas-data-sheet,rov-hector-7-datasheet"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 will be used.
 The vehicle will likely be at the larger and heavier end of existing ROVs
 as the vehicle must now have the onboard energy capabilities to complete
 a mission without a constant power supply from the surface vessel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the UUV is now expected to operate independently of the surface vessel,
 it should have the ability to bi-directionally, wirelessly communicate
 with the surface vessel.
 Uses for such a communications channel include the UUV reporting its mission
 status and the surface vessel providing high-level instructions such as
 
\emph on
return home
\emph default
 orders.
 When operating underwater, acoustic signals are the primary medium for
 wireless communication.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Navigation
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As previously described, the navigation system will primarily be built on
 the principle of 
\emph on
dead reckoning
\emph default
 using an inertial navigation system (INS).
 An INS uses input from many types of sensor such as accelerometers and
 gyroscopes to measure the movement of the vehicle and hence infer its location.
 None of these could individually provide an accurate determination of location
 and as such 
\emph on
sensor fusion
\emph default
 is employed.
 Each sensor has an associated measurement uncertainty which compounds over
 time, sensor fusion allows all the sensor measurements to be combined in
 such a way as to produce a single output measurement with an uncertainty
 smaller than any of each sensor individually.
 A common method for implementing sensor fusion is using a

\begin_layout Standard
However, despite the use of a Kalman filter allowing more precise approximations
 of the vehicle's relative location, the lack of external calibration means
 that the overall uncertainty will still increase over time.
 In land-based robotics this is mitigated through the use of periodic GPS
 measurements which have low, constant uncertainty and help to place an
 upper bound on the overall error.
 As previously mentioned, GNSS systems do not work deep underwater and as
 such, another method for providing these external updates must be used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following proposes methods for providing global positioning to the UUV
 without a traditional GNSS system.
 This will be completed in two stages, the first being to provide the UUV
 with the ability to measure the location of a fixed point relative to itself.
 In parallel, the global co-ordinates of this fixed point will be communicated
 to the UUV in order to infer its own global location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Underwater Acoustic Positioning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alongside the use of acoustic signals for communications it will also be
 employed for positioning.
 One application for this is underwater acoustic positioning which employs
 the use of time-of-flight measurements to beacons of a known location to
 triangulate an object's location.
 There are different configurations for such a system depending on how these
 beacons are laid out, 
\emph on
long-baseline
\emph default
 (LBL) systems involve beacons located on the sea floor.
 Spreading these beacons around the working area of an ROV widens the baseline
 of the system and provides higher accuracy when triangulating.
 This configuration is best suited to static areas of research such as ship
 wrecks where an initial time devoted to deploying and calibrating these
 underwater beacons is a reasonable expense to pay for the required high
 accuracy.
 This is not the case for sub-sea cable repairs where the deployment, calibratio
n and recovery of beacons on the seabed would be prohibitively complex and
 add significant time to the duration of a mission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Short-baseline
\emph default
 (SBL) systems involve a number of beacons placed at the furthest corners
 of the surface vessel, this has the benefit of requiring little set-up
 and pack-down at the cost of reduced accuracy.
 Relative to the UUV these beacons are all on a similar bearing when operating
 at a distance, as a result changes in the vehicle's location would be reflected
 in similar changes to the measurements from all of the beacons.
 Previously, with a long-baseline, the beacons are ideally surrounding the
 UUV's working area and changes in its location are reflected in different
 distance deltas for each beacon allowing tighter triangulation.
 Accuracy can be improved by extending the beacons away from the vessel
 to extend the baseline as far as possible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One method to mitigate the drawbacks of both described methods is by using
 GPS Intelligent Buoys (GIBs).
 This configuration, also referred to as an 
\emph on
inverted long-baseline
\emph default
, allows a much wider baseline than the surface-vessel-mounted beacons by
 deploying a group of 
\emph on
smart buoys
\emph default
 around the expected working area of the UUV.
 The use of buoys as opposed to beacons on the sea-floor significantly decreases
 the preparation and clean-up mission phases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of these methods it is proposed that the surface vessel be equipped with
 a short-baseline beacon array as well as a population of GIBs.
 This will allow the choice between higher accuracy or faster mission turnaround
 be decided by mission conditions as well as providing redundancy for either
 system.
 In shallower waters, the accuracy of the onboard SBL may be deemed sufficient
 however in deeper water where the UUV is operating far further from the
 surface vessel, the compactness of the SBL baseline may require the higher
 accuracy of the GIBs
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In practice the two could be used in conjunction for efficiency.
 As the UUV is deployed it initially uses the onboard SBL array while the
 surface vessel makes a pass around the working area deploying GIBs for
 use as the UUV gets deeper
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The GIBs would be considered additional accuracy, the SBL would be used
 alongside the GIBs and act as an extra node in the array.
 Additionally the weather and sea conditions could play a factor in the
 decision.
 In higher sea states and stormy weather, the deployment and recovery of
 GIBs may be deemed too risky and the SBL could be used alone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Global Calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above underwater acoustic positioning system will allow the UUV to keep
 track of its position relative to known points at the surface, however
 this alone will not provide the UUV with its global location.
 In order for the UUV to calibrate its local map to global co-ordinates,
 the global position of these surface points must be provided.
 This will be conducted over the previously described acoustic communication
 channel.
 As it could be expected that this channel has a low bandwidth, these updates
 need not be excessively frequent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While accelerometers and gyroscopes would be expected components of any
 mobile dead reckoning navigation system, additional sensors well-suited
 to sub-sea localisation will allow the vessel's movement to be more precise.
 One such sensor is a 
\emph on
Doppler velocity log
\emph default
 (DVL) which estimates the vessel's velocity by tracking the seabed.
 DVLs apply the broader concept of 
\emph on
acoustic Doppler current profiling
\emph default
 which measures the velocity of water by measuring the change in frequency
 caused by the Doppler effect.
 Combined with depth measurements calculated from the signal's echo time,
 this can be used to estimate the vessel's velocity.
 DVLs are crucial to a sub-sea INS as, like GPS, their error does not grow
 when employed correctly unlike other relative sensors.
 As described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Navigation"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

, a sensor who's measurement error does not compound and grow but stays
 constant is important as it places an upper bound on the overall error
 and allows the system to maintain accuracy over time.

Power

\begin_layout Standard
The ability to operate autonomously without an umbilical cord implies that
 the UUV must have an onboard power supply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned, much of the vehicle specification is being inherited from
 existing ROV technology and this would include expected operating power.
 The expansion of the UUV's capabilities to include autonomous operation
 would primarily be completed through software and not significantly alter
 the required power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
300 kW was used as the required max power to calculate the energy storage
 capabilities, an operating time of 10 hours was also defined.

) will be used for the UUV's battery pack, this will allow a single process
 for sourcing and end-of-life processing and increase efficiency by utilising
 the economy of scale.
 As such, the previously mentioned notes on sustainability including processes
 for second-use and recycling would apply to the UUVs battery pack.

 Lithium-polymer batteries have found usage in AUVs as a result of their
 lighter weight than Lithium-ion batteries.
 While this will increase efficiency, it is proposed that the use of a single

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cell voltage (3.6 V) and capacity (3.5 Ah) were multiplied for 12.6 Wh
 of power capacity per cell.
 This would require 119,048 cells to meet the capacity requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The battery system constitutes an extra 5,700 kg of extra weight for the
 UUV, it is important that the battery be removable for tethered operation
 in order to increase efficiency when independent operation is not required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As this battery array will experience less usage than the surface vessel's
 set, it is expected that it will last longer.
 Despite undergoing less charge cycles, Lithium-ion cells still have a finite
 lifespan and would not be expected to last beyond 4 years.
 As such this is defined as the battery replacement time period.

LARS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposal for hybrid AUV/ROV capabilities somewhat simplifies the required
 LARS methods.
 As the vehicle must still be able to operate while tethered, from the surface
 vessel's perspective a traditional LARS system with a top-hat TMS will
 be used.
 When operating as an ROV, the underwater vehicle will not have the battery
 system mounted on the top and the tether will directly connect to the vehicle.
 In these scenarios the LARS processes will be as previously described,

However, the difference in usage patterns for the UUV may make the battery's
 applicability to second-usage less viable.
 This would be because it would be expected to sustain higher depth-of-discharge
 without the ability to activate more ammonia cells and keep the capacity
 higher.
 As such the direct recycling processes previously described may be more
 appropriate as an end-of-life procedure.

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed UUV describes an extension to existing ROV capabilities by
 allowing untethered autonomous operations.
 This requires a wireless communication channel between the surface and
 underwater vessel which will be completed using acoustic waves.
 The UUV will effectively be GNSS-enabled by proxy from the surface vessel,
 allowing it to navigate to the fault locations.
 In order to operate autonomously, the UUV will require onboard power, a
 battery system of suitable scale was described along with protocols for
 decommissioning sustainably.

), the power from the ammonia fuel cells will primarily be varied by changing
 the population of active cells as opposed to drawing varied power from
 each individually.
 This allows the cells to operate as much as possible in their most efficient
 state.
 However, cells require time to turn on and reach this efficient state,
 about 20 minutes.
 This was modelled by having the input power move in discrete steps as cells
 are turned on and off.
 This step value was defined as 200kW, the most efficient state for a single
 fuel cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As time increases, every twenty minutes the amount of active cells can be
 incremented or decremented.
 This over-simplifies the actual behaviour as this would, in reality, be

In order to model the load draw from the propulsion and hotel load, a random

 This was done in order to provide a dynamic environment, were the load
 power to stay the same the battery would either charge or discharge entirely
 and then stay in this state.
 A random change each second more closely matches the expected power requirement
s as the wind and currents are also dynamic.

In terms of applicability, the model provides a good high-level approximation

 by one at each twenty minute interval when in reality many could be activated
