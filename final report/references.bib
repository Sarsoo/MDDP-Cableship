@article{lawsone-high-voltage-flow-battery,
	abstract = {Recently, redox-flow batteries (RFBs) are drawing intensive attention due to their advantages of peak shaving, grid flexibility and long life time. All-vanadium RFBs are most widely employed, but the high cost and toxicity hinder their large-scale applications. As potential substitutes, development of organic-based aqueous RFBs is impeded by a lack of electroactive pairs with combination of high cell voltage and sufficient cycle stability. In this work, a novel biomolecule-based aqueous RFB with high performance was successfully fabricated. Lawsone, a renewable biomolecule derived from natural henna, was developed as a stable anolyte. By paring with 4-HO-TEMPO, the as-assembled RFB exhibits a high operating voltage above 1.30 V, which is among the highest records. Meanwhile, the capacity retention rate reaches 99.992\% per cycle. This work highlights the rational utilization of redox-active biomolecule to construct sustainable, low-cost and high-performance aqueous RFBs.},

	abstract = {In light of the increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the global vehicle market, understanding the environmental impacts of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) that characterize the EVs is key to sustainable EV deployment. This study analyzes the cradle-to-gate total energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, SOx, NOx, PM10 emissions, and water consumption associated with current industrial production of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries, with the battery life cycle analysis (LCA) module in the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model, which was recently updated with primary data collected from large-scale commercial battery material producers and automotive LIB manufacturers. The results show that active cathode material, aluminum, and energy use for cell production are the major contributors to the energy and environmental impacts of NMC batteries. However, this study also notes that the impacts could change significantly, depending on where in the world the battery is produced, and where the materials are sourced. In an effort to harmonize existing LCAs of automotive LIBs and guide future research, this study also lays out differences in life cycle inventories (LCIs) for key battery materials among existing LIB LCA studies, and identifies knowledge gaps.},

@article{lithium-lca,
	abstract = {Battery technology is increasingly seen as an integral element for future energy and transportation systems. Current developments in industry show an increasing number and size of battery producing factories, thus leading to an immense energy demand not only during the production of battery cells but also raw material extraction. Determining the embodied energy of battery cells allows a comparison with alternative energy systems and assessing the overall energy demand that can contribute to define measures for the improvement of its environmental footprint. The present work provides an analysis of the production of battery cells regarding their embodied energy. In order to quantify the embodied energy, a material and energy flow analysis (MEFA) was adapted towards battery production. The methodology focuses on the manufacturing processes and considers indirect and direct energy consumers, different machine states and existing yield losses along the value chain. The approach was applied to the battery manufacturing in the Battery LabFactory Braunschweig (BLB).},

@article{SSB-challenges-paper,
	abstract = {The recent discovery of highly conductive solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) has led to tremendous progress in the development of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Though promising, they still face barriers that limit their practical application, such as poor interfacial stability, scalability challenges and production safety. Additionally, efforts to develop sustainable manufacturing of lithium ion batteries are still lacking, with no prevailing strategy developed yet to handle recyclability of ASSBs. To date, most SSE research has been largely focused on the discovery of novel electrolytes. Recent review articles have extensively examined a broad spectrum of these SSEs using evaluation factors such as conductivity and chemical stability. Recognizing this, in this Review we seek to evaluate SSEs beyond conventional factors and offer a perspective on various bulk, interface and nanoscale phenomena that require urgent attention within the scientific community. We provide a realistic assessment of the current state-of-the-art characterization techniques and evaluate future full cell ASSB prototyping strategies. We hope to offer rational solutions to overcome some major fundamental obstacles faced by the ASSB community, as well as potential strategies toward a sustainable ASSB recycling model.},

@article{li-ion-degradation,
	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are popular energy storage devices for a wide variety of applications. As batteries have transitioned from being used in portable electronics to being used in longer lifetime and more safety-critical applications, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and aircraft, the cost of failure has become more significant both in terms of liability as well as the cost of replacement. Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis (FMMEA) provides a rigorous framework to define the ways in which lithium-ion batteries can fail, how failures can be detected, what processes cause the failures, and how to model failures for failure prediction. This enables a physics-of-failure (PoF) approach to battery life prediction that takes into account life cycle conditions, multiple failure mechanisms, and their effects on battery health and safety. This paper presents an FMMEA of battery failure and describes how this process enables improved battery failure mitigation control strategies.},

@article{li-direct-recycling,
	abstract = {Direct recycling of lithium-ion is a promising method for manufacturing sustainability. It is more efficient than classical methods because it recovers the functional cathode particle without decomposition into substituent elements or dissolution and precipitation of the whole particle. This case study of cathode-healing™ applied to a battery recall demonstrates an industrial model for recycling of lithium-ion, be it consumer electronic or electric vehicle (EV) batteries. The comprehensive process includes extraction of electrolyte with carbon dioxide, industrial shredding, electrode harvesting, froth flotation, cathode-healing™ and finally, building new cells with recycled cathode and anode. The final products demonstrated useful capability in the first full cells made from direct recycled cathodes and anodes from an industrial source. The lessons learned on recycling the prototypical chemistry are preliminarily applied to EV relevant chemistries.},
