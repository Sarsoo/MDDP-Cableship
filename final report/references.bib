  abstract = {Recently, redox-flow batteries (RFBs) are drawing intensive attention due to their advantages of peak shaving, grid flexibility and long life time. All-vanadium RFBs are most widely employed, but the high cost and toxicity hinder their large-scale applications. As potential substitutes, development of organic-based aqueous RFBs is impeded by a lack of electroactive pairs with combination of high cell voltage and sufficient cycle stability. In this work, a novel biomolecule-based aqueous RFB with high performance was successfully fabricated. Lawsone, a renewable biomolecule derived from natural henna, was developed as a stable anolyte. By paring with 4-HO-TEMPO, the as-assembled RFB exhibits a high operating voltage above 1.30 V, which is among the highest records. Meanwhile, the capacity retention rate reaches 99.992% per cycle. This work highlights the rational utilization of redox-active biomolecule to construct sustainable, low-cost and high-performance aqueous RFBs.},

This study analyzes the cradle-to-gate total energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, SOx, NOx, PM10 emissions, and water consumption associated with current industrial production of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) batteries, with the battery life cycle analysis (LCA) module in the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model, which was recently updated with primary data collected from large-scale commercial battery material producers and automotive LIB manufacturers. The results show that active cathode material, aluminum, and energy use for cell production are the major contributors to the energy and environmental impacts of NMC batteries. However, this study also notes that the impacts could change significantly, depending on where in the world the battery is produced, and where the materials are sourced. In an effort to harmonize existing LCAs of automotive LIBs and guide future research, this study also lays out differences in life cycle inventories (LCIs) for key battery materials among existing LIB LCA studies, and identifies knowledge gaps.},

  abstract = {Battery technology is increasingly seen as an integral element for future energy and transportation systems. Current developments in industry show an increasing number and size of battery producing factories, thus leading to an immense energy demand not only during the production of battery cells but also raw material extraction. Determining the embodied energy of battery cells allows a comparison with alternative energy systems and assessing the overall energy demand that can contribute to define measures for the improvement of its environmental footprint. The present work provides an analysis of the production of battery cells regarding their embodied energy. In order to quantify the embodied energy, a material and energy flow analysis (MEFA) was adapted towards battery production. The methodology focuses on the manufacturing processes and considers indirect and direct energy consumers, different machine states and existing yield losses along the value chain. The approach was applied to the battery manufacturing in the Battery LabFactory Braunschweig (BLB).},
